### 'Placidus' version

![Placidus][Placidus]

The first stable release, codename *Placidus*, was launched in November 2014 to be hardily tested during the *[OSHWDEM A Coru√±a 2014][OSH01]* with every child who visited us in the event. Every Escornabot was kept in one piece after 2 intensive days playing with the children (and also with some aged people :)

This version mounted the first and second chassis models, both of them with the motor-driver boards at right and left sides and the button set on the top. The first Bluetooth interface was implemented in this version and it could be controlled sending text lines describing movement commands with an *Android Bluetooth terminal* app.

### 'Brivoi' version

![Brivoi][Brivoi]

It was launched on the [*Streets Science Day*][SCI01] in May 2015. The new chassis design is more compact reducing the plastic and printing time down to 50%. It incorporates the concept of modular hardware to join the parts with brackets to the electronics, batteries and other optional modules. Another interesting feature, due to its small size, is the possibility to make turns in square cells of 10cm x 10cm.

The firmware is able to detect long key press and doubling the functions for keypad, introduces the pause command and the code is simplified to allow extend the Escornabot behaviour easily.

Specific hardware boards were designed: the _Escornaboard_ integrating the Arduino Nano, a controller for two stepper motors, the buzzer and other useful connectors and switches in a 5cm x 5cm board; the _Escornashield Keypad_ simplifying the construction of the keypad and, an _Arduino Shield_ ready to connect to Arduino Uno/Mega
