# Community

Escornabot is a project leaded and supported by the community. Teachers, makers, designers, software developers, document writers, interpreters... everyone is welcome!

## Support

### Mailing list

Mainly, we prefer you expose your questions in our mailing lists so that you get a quick answer and more people will be able to solve recurrent problems. These are the current mailing list:

  * [Escornabot Users][ESU01] (common questions, proposal of new features, associated games, non-technical details). 
  * [Escornabot Developers][ESD01] (technical details, development bugs and solutions).

English, Spanish and Galician languages are used in both mailing list. When English speakers grow we will split the list by language.

### Github and Wiki:

You can find the development branches of code, electronics and 3D files on our Github[GIT01]. There's also a communitiy supported [wiki about escornabot][WIK01], in which you can find (In Spanish at this time), resources, activities, enhancementes... developed and published by escornabot's fans!
